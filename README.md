# sys-SpotyNX
A sysmodule for Nintendo Switch for playing musics at background.
Currently Heavily WIP so daily usage is not recommended.

## What's Working ?
- Playing musics.
- Pause/Resume musics.

## How to use ?
Install the sysmodule and then just put the songs to directory " sdmc:/spoty-musics/ " and then install and use ovl-SpotyNX to start playing your favorite songs while gaming !

## What's coming up for sys-SpotyNX ?
- Skipping the songs.
- Randomly playing musics.
