# sys-SpotyNX
A sysmodule for Nintendo Switch for playing musics at background.
Currently Heavily WIP so daily usage is not recommended.

## What's Working ?
- Playing musics.
- Pause/Resume musics.
- Playing the next music.
- Currently playing musics alphabeticly.

## How to use ?
Install the sysmodule and then just put the songs to directory " sdmc:/spoty-musics/ " and then ZR+A to start playing the songs. Or ZR+X to Pause/Resume.

## What's coming up for sys-SpotyNX ?
- Skipping the songs.
- Randomly playing musics.
- SpotyNX-Applet so you can queue songs with a more user-friendly usage.

## Responsibility
I'm not reponsible for anything. Stuck or Dead switches included.
